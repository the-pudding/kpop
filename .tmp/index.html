		    <p>This is BTS, or ‘Beyond the Scene’. They are the hottest K-pop band right now.</p>
		    <img id='bts-lead' src='assets/images/kpop_top_notext.png'>
		    <p>In fact, they are en route to becoming the biggest band in the world. Since their debut in 2013, they’ve set world records on Billboard, Youtube, and Twitter, and embarked on sold-out world tours outperforming Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. Their popularity has been likened to Beatlemania of the 60s. And by raking in $3.6 billion in 2019—that’s 0.3% of South Korea’s GDP!—they sure are giving the Beatles a run for their money.</p>
		    <p>All these accolades ought to give the K-pop industry—long criticized for churning out cookie-cutter idols and music—cause for celebration. Except BTS is an outlier in K-pop. They did not debut under any of the ‘Big 3’ entertainment agencies at the time, whose deep pockets help groom trainees into superstars. They also produce some of their own music and manage their own Twitter account; a rarity in an industry known for their tight control over all aspects of their idols’ lives. Were the critics right, then? Is BTS a phenomenon because they do not fit into the K-pop mold, or do they just play the game better than everyone else?</p>
		    <p>The answer lies somewhere in between. Current impressions of the K-pop industry may be that it’s formulaic, and that it’s too big of an institution to innovate. But its history proves otherwise; K-pop has always been about reinvention. What we now recognize as key characteristics of K-pop groups—their big group size and varied group positions—were once new ideas that got co-opted into the playbook. So while BTS is commendable in many ways, their success was built on the shoulders of giants.</p>
		    <p>To understand BTS’s place in K-pop, let’s take it back to 1992, when Seo Taiji and Boys—widely regarded as the world’s first K-pop band—formed.</p>

		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='generation-1-label'>Generation 1</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>Seo Taiji and Boys burst into Korea’s entertainment scene in 1992, a streetwear-clad trio (complete with ski gloves) breakdancing to catchy rap tunes. Despite receiving the lowest score in the history of a televised program[1] in their debut performance, the audience lapped it up, presumably starved after years of listening to censored, nationalistic songs.[2]<br><br>Not long after, other groups tried to emulate their runaway success with a similar three-member, leader-vocalist-rapper configuration.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay generation-2-wrapper' data-step=2>
		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='generation-2-label'>Generation 2</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>The next K-pop revolution came in the mid-2000s, when Super Junior and Girls’ Generation debuted under SM Entertainment.<br><br>Their large size made both groups outliers initially, but their stratospheric rise convinced the rest of the industry of the merits of large groups. Fans could now pick their 'bias' (favorite member) from a bevy of idols, and groups could perform elaborate choreography without backup dancers.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay generation-3-wrapper' data-step=3>
		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='generation-3-label'>Generation 3</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>The third generation of idols took note of this, but went even further, perhaps out of necessity to differentiate themselves from the numerous K-pop groups that have popped up.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay supergroups-wrapper' data-step=4>
		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='supergroups-label'>Supergroups</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>We start seeing <font color=’#FCA972’>'super-size groups'</font>—10 members and more—emerging at a consistent rate in the 2010s. Part of the reason is that in this decade, K-pop agencies began proactively holding global auditions in hopes of widening K-pop’s international appeal. By scouting beyond home ground, agencies had a large talent pool to draw from when forming new K-pop groups.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay subunits-wrapper' data-step=5>
		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='subunits-label'>Subunits</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>It wasn’t just about adding more headcount. Larger groups have the flexibility of breaking into smaller <font color=’#FCA972’>'subunits'</font>. Subunits are extensions of the main group that have different concepts, music genres, or songs produced in non-Korean languages to target a diverse range of markets.<br><br>One K-pop group, New Culture Technology (NCT), has taken this to the nth degree. At 21 members, they are currently the largest group in K-pop history. But their creator, Lee Soo-man, is relentless. He envisions NCT to have an unlimited number of members, with an NCT subunit planted in every city in the world. Talk about world domination through the soft power of K-pop.</p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		
		</div>		<div class='part3'>
		
		  <!-- pre chart text -->
		  <div class='prose'>
		    <p>Looking at the top ten groups by record sales, we can see this has proven to be a lucrative strategy. Most of the third-generation groups that made the top 10 have co-opted the subunits strategy.</p>
		  </div>
		
		  <!-- flourish chart to be sticky -->

		    <div class='step overlay idol-shows-wrapper' data-step=1>
		      <h2 class='generation-label' id='idol-label'>Idol Survival Shows</h2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>Another recent innovation in the K-pop world is “idol survival shows”. Here’s how these work: several trainees from various entertainment agencies compete in different rounds to eventually debut together as a new girl or boy group. The most popular show, Produce 101[a][b][c], allowed fans to 'produce' their dream K-pop group from 101 trainees by voting on the group’s concept, debut song, name, and member line-up. This took the guesswork out of whether fans would like the group or not—the band was literally a product of popular choice[d][e].</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay' data-step=2>
		      <p class='generation-description'>This leaves BTS as the only third-generation group in the top 10 without a subunit, and one formed by the then small outfit, BigHit Entertainment, rather than fromidol survival shows sponsored by bigger companies.</p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		
		</div>		<div class='part4'>
		
		<!-- pre chart text--> 
		  <div class='prose'>
		    <p>Not being overproduced has worked in BTS’s favor. They come across as relatable and authentic artists who happen to be global superstars, rather than inaccessible idols. That’s not to say that BTS’s success was by luck. They had the foresight to sign with a smaller agency, despite being scouted by more established agencies, and this gave them greater artistic freedom and control over the group’s direction. Had they debuted under the original Big 3 agencies, they might still be successful, but not exceptional.</p>
		
		    <p>It also helps that BTS’s main medium of expression is rap, which has historically, and more so in recent years, resurfaced as the popular anthem for the disenfranchised and marginalised. Their songs speak to youths around the world, who see their struggles reflected in themes like mental health, generational divide, and school pressure.</p>
		    <p>A lot of the credit goes to BTS’s ‘rap line’, who drew on their own experiences when co-writing their songs. This brings us to the other half of what makes K-pop groups unique—group configuration. Unlike most pop bands that have a lead singer, drummer, and two guitarists, K-pop groups can have several positions. A line, or category, in say rap, can be further divided into four positions made up of a lead rapper, main rapper, sub rapper, and rapper. Such segmentation serves a functional purpose. It creates a clear division of labour in terms of allocating screen time, song parts, and placement in photoshoots and performances.</p>
		    <p>This subdivision applies to other categories too. While positions are usually assigned based on individual ability, they also signal who the important members are, by placing them in popular positions.</p>
		
		    <div class='roles-grid'>
		      <img id ='first-role-image' src='assets/images/seniority-group.svg'>
		      <div class='side-by-side'>
		        <img src='assets/images/rapper_roles_long.svg'>
		        <img src='assets/images/vocalist-group.svg'>
		        <img src='assets/images/appearance-group.svg'>
		        <img src='assets/images/dancer-group.svg'>
		      </div>
		    </div>
		
		    <p>But what’s considered popular changes. Across K-pop’s history, a hugely popular group or member can result in the waxing and waning of certain positions. Jungkook from BTS did just that. He popularized the maknae role, supposedly the ‘baby’ of the group, by defying expectations. He excelled in everything, giving him the nickname, “Golden Maknae”, and played pranks on his hyungs (the older BTS members). The latter may not sound like much, until you consider how enshrined of a custom respecting the senior-junior hierarchy is in South Korea.</p>
		    <img src='assets/images/kpop_top.svg'>
		    <p>Apart from BTS, how have other icons incentivized the industry to adapt, and in doing so, made K-pop groups the way they are today? Let’s take a look.</p>
		
		  </div>
		
		<!-- here is the flourish chart to become sticky -->
		  <div class='chart'>
		    <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/220054" id='rankings'><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
		  </div>
		
		<!-- adding scrolly text elements below -->
		  <div class='prose' id='rankings-text'>
		    <div class='step overlay seniority-wrapper' data-step=1>
		      <h2 class='group' id='seniority-label'>Seniority</h2>
		      <p class='group-description'>And it's not just anecdotal. Looking at the data, we can see how much more important the maknae role is today than it was when Seo Taiji and Boys first sported ski gloves. All the groups that debuted in 2018 and 2019 had maknaes. The ‘maknae line versus hyung/unnie (elder brother/sister) line’ dynamic, specifically, came to define the third generation of K-pop groups. Popularized by BLACKPINK and BTS, it features younger members engaging in goofy high jinks at the expense of older members. This helps showcase the group’s dynamics and endear fans (who are closer in age to the maknaes), translating to greater popularity for the group.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay rap-wrapper' data-step=2>
		      <h2 class='group' id='rap-label'>Rap</h2>
		      <p class='group-description'>Popularized by Seo Taiji and Boys, and DJ DOC in the early 90s, rap fit into the zeitgeist of a new and fully democratic South Korea. These groups wrote lyrics criticizing the government, education system, and other social injustices. Their words spoke to the sinsedae (new) generation[3], who grew up consuming American media in the backdrop of an authoritarian regime. For these groups, rap formed the core of their identities, as seen in their choice of clothes, music, and choreography.<br><br>As the Hallyu (Korea) wave swept K-pop into the international spotlight from the late 90s on, the K-pop industry had to work hard to feed this demand. This meant fine-tuning the system for easy replication, resulting in less experimentation and more standardization. As a result, rap positions became differentiated. Main and lead rappers—who had clear directions on who would rap more lines and during which parts—grew under this new direction.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay vocals-wrapper' data-step=3>
		      <h2 class='group' id='vocals-label'>Vocals</h2>
		      <p class='group-description'>Unlike rap, which eventually branched into the more specific main and lead positions, the vocalist position continues to dominate through the years. This is less a testament to the role’s enduring popularity, rather than its flexibility. Because vocalists support the main and lead vocalists by singing only a few lines, they are usually more of a filler position. Members who are vocalists typically have main or lead positions in other categories.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay aesthetics-wrapper' data-step=4>
		      <h2 class='group' id='aesthetics-label'>Aesthetics</h2>
		      <p class='group-description'>K-pop aesthetics today are almost as well-known as their songs—think colorful hair, distinctive concept albums, and slick music videos.<br><br>But up until 2006, the positions of the face and the visual were almost non-existent. Their value-add, compared to 'skill-based' positions like vocalists, were not obvious.<br><br>Enter Yoona from Girls’ Generation. As the visual of the band, she skyrocketed the group’s popularity by appearing in many television ads and variety shows. The industry noticed; since Girls’ Generation debuted in 2007, there has been a spike in both face and visual roles in K-pop, with visual roles taking the lead for the most part.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class='step overlay dance-wrapper' data-step=5 id='final-group'>
		      <h2 class='group' id='dance-label'>Dance</h2>
		      <p class='group-description'>Changes in dance positions and group size go hand in hand. Group sizes were small in the 1990s, and there wasn’t really a need to designate a dancer position, as everyone danced in unison. As groups expanded, they took on enough members to fill more specific roles like main and lead dancers, who take on dance solos.<br><br>Since 2012, the combination of a large group with specialized dance positions facilitated a new trend: third-generation groups began incorporating formation choreography and transitions into their performances. Examples include EXO’s V-to-X formation and Seventeen’s ‘chain reaction’.</p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		
		</div>		<div class='part5'>
		  <div class='prose'>
		    <p>Relative to other music genres, K-pop is young. But in the short time since 1992, it has grown to become the cultural behemoth it is today. What has been consistent throughout K-pop’s history is the industry’s willingness to reinvent based on the responses it receives from South Korean society. Group positions, with their clearly defined functions, mirror the hierarchical ethos of South Korea. Group sizes have evolved alongside South Korea’s consumption habits, as greater access to online content called for bigger and showier performances. As international as K-pop has become, it remains steeped in South Korea’s ethos, which may explain why foreign ‘K-pop’ groups have all been flops.</p>
		    <p>To many, especially in the West, BTS may be their first exposure to K-pop. That’s understandable, since no group has broken into the U.S. market quite as successfully before. And even though the boys deserve all the hype, BTS’s success did not emerge from nowhere. Or to paraphrase another rap legend, Jay-Z, K-pop ran so that BTS could fly.</p>

		    <h2 id='methods-label'>Methodology</h2>
		    <p id='methods'>The dataset for K-pop groups was based on Wikipedia’s list of South Korean idol groups.[4] We then narrowed the list to include only groups with K-pop listed as a genre (except Seo Taiji and Boys, because they were the first K-pop group). Group sizes and positions were collected from K Profiles.[5] We determined the top 10 third-generation groups based on Gaon’s Album Chart from 2011–2019.</p>
