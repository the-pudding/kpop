{"title":"Examining K-pop’s Formula: Large Groups, Defined Roles","dek":"Does BTS conform to the seemingly cookie-cutter approach to K-pop groups?","intro1":"This is <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"bts\">BTS</span>, the hottest act in music right now.","intro2":"Since debuting in 2013, BTS has set records on Billboard, YouTube, and Twitter and embarked on sold-out world tours, outperforming Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. The group’s overwhelming popularity has been likened to Beatlemania of the ’60s.","intro3":"These accolades ought to give the industry behind K-pop (Korean Pop)—long criticized for churning out acts that follow a standard formula—cause for celebration. Except BTS is an outlier in K-pop, and it did not debut under any of the <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"The ‘Big 3’ refers to SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment, the biggest players in the K-pop industry.\">“Big 3” entertainment agencies</span>, which gave the group greater artistic freedom and control over its direction.","intro4":"We wanted to understand where BTS fits in the evolution of two characteristics of this formula: large group sizes and varied group positions. To try to answer the question, we analyzed data on 314 K-pop bands collected from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_Korean_idol_groups>Wikipedia</a>, and the answer lies somewhere in between.","header1":"Group Sizes","intro5":"Let’s go back to 1992, when <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"seo\">Seo Taiji and Boys</span>—widely regarded as the world’s first K-pop band—formed.","bars1":"Seo Taiji and Boys burst onto Korea’s entertainment scene as a streetwear-clad trio (complete with ski gloves) breakdancing to catchy rap tunes. During their debut performance, the audience lapped it up, presumably starved after years of listening to <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"why relevant to kpop\">censored, nationalistic songs</span>.<br><br>Not long after, other groups tried to emulate their runaway success with a similar three-member, leader-vocalist-rapper configuration.","bars2":"The second generation of K-pop came in the mid-2000s, when <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"super\">Super Junior</span>, with 11 members, and <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"girls\">Girls’ Generation</span>, with 8 members, debuted under SM Entertainment.<br><br>The number of members for each made both groups outliers initially, but their stratospheric rise signaled the merits of such large groups. Fans could now pick their “bias,” i.e., their favorite member, from a bevy of idols, and groups could perform elaborate choreography without backup dancers.","bars3":"The third generation of idols came in the 2010s. These groups, which includes BTS, continued the trend towards larger group sizes.","bars4":"So, we started seeing “super-size groups”—10 members or more—emerging at a consistent rate. To capitalize on K-pop's international growth, agencies began proactively holding global auditions.","bars5":"Another feature emerged from the trend of larger groups: subunits. These are extensions of the main group that have different concepts and sometimes produce songs in non-Korean languages or in different genres to target a diverse range of markets.<br><br><span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"nct\">New Culture Technology (NCT)</span> has 21 members, currently the largest group in K-pop history. Their creator, Lee Soo-man, envisions NCT with an unlimited number of members, a subunit planted in every city in the world.","topten1":"Another recent change is “idol survival shows.” Trainees from various entertainment agencies compete in televised challenges to eventually debut together as a new girl or boy group. The most popular show, <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"Wanna One, the 5th most popular K-pop band in 2019, was formed on Produce 101’s second season.\">Produce 101</span> allows fans to “produce” their dream K-pop group from 101 trainees by voting on the group’s concept, debut song, name, and member lineup.","topten2":"Looking at the top 10 K-pop groups by record sales in 2019, we can see this has proven to be a lucrative strategy: 9 of the top 10 bands have used the subunits strategy, and 3 are the product of idol survival shows.","topten3":"This leaves BTS as the only group in the top 10 without a subunit. They were formed by the then small outfit BigHit Entertainment, rather than from idol survival shows sponsored by bigger companies.","rankings01":"A lot of the credit goes to BTS’s rappers, who draw on their own experiences when writing their songs. This brings us to the other half of what makes K-pop groups unique: group configuration. Whereas most pop-rock bands typically consist of a lead singer, a drummer, a bassist, and a guitarist, K-pop groups are constructed in lines, or categories, which are divided into specialized roles. A rap line, for example, can be made up of a lead rapper, a main rapper, and a sub rapper, each with a part to play.","rankings02":"Such segmentation creates a division of labor in terms of allocating screen time, song parts, and placement in photoshoots and performances. While positions are usually assigned[a][b][c][d][e] based on individual ability, they also signal which members are important.","rankings03":"Across K-pop’s history, a hugely popular group or member can result in the waxing and waning of certain positions. <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"jungkook\">Jungkook</span> from BTS popularized the maknae role, supposedly the “baby” of the group, by defying expectations. He excelled in everything, giving him the nickname Golden Maknae, and played pranks on his hyungs (the older BTS members).","rankings04":"Apart from BTS, how have other icons pushed the industry to adapt and, in doing so, made K-pop groups what they are today?","rankings1":"To investigate how other positions have changed over time, we looked at which K-pop bands had a member in each role.<br><br>For example, it’s clear how much more important the <i>maknae</i> role is today than it was when Seo Taiji and Boys first sported ski gloves. In fact, all the groups that debuted in 2018 and 2019 had <i>maknaes</i>. The “<i>maknae</i> versus <i>hyung/unnie</i> (elder brother/sister)” dynamic has come to define the third generation of K-pop groups. Popularized by <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"blackpink\">BLACKPINK</span> and BTS, it features younger members engaging in goofy antics at the expense of older members. This helps showcase the group’s dynamics and endear fans (who are closer in age to the maknaes).","rankings2":"Popularized by Seo Taiji and Boys, and<span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"djdoc\">DJ DOC</span> in the early ’90s, hip-hop fit into the zeitgeist of a new and fully democratic South Korea. These groups wrote rap lyrics criticizing the government, education system, and social injustices. Their words spoke to the <i>sinsedae</i> (new generation), who grew up freely consuming American media. For these groups, hip-hop formed the core of their identities, as seen in their choice of clothes, music, and choreography.<br><br>And as the Hallyu (Korean Wave) swept K-pop into the international spotlight during the late ’90s, the K-pop industry had to keep up with demand. This meant fine-tuning the system for easy replication, resulting in less experimentation and more standardization. Main and lead rappers—who had clear roles on who would rap more lines and during which parts—grew under this new direction.","rankings3":"Unlike rap, a part that eventually branched out to the more specific main and lead positions, the vocalist position continues to dominate. Because vocalists support the main and lead vocalists by singing only a few lines, they are usually more of a filler position. Members who are vocalists typically have main or lead positions in other categories.","rankings4":"K-pop aesthetics today are almost as well-known as their songs—colorful hair, distinctive concept albums, and slick music videos.<br><br>But until 2006, the positions of the face and the visual were almost non-existent. Their value-add, compared to “skill-based” positions such as vocalists, was not obvious.<br><br>Enter <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"yoona\">Yoona</span> from Girls’ Generation. As the visual of the band, she skyrocketed the group’s popularity by appearing in many television ads and variety shows. The industry noticed; since Girls’ Generation debuted in 2007, there has been a spike in both face and visual roles in K-pop, with visual roles taking the lead for the most part.","rankings5":"Changes in dance positions and group size go hand in hand. Group sizes were small in the ’90s, and there wasn’t really a need to designate a dancer position, as everyone danced in unison. As groups expanded, they took on enough members to fill more specific roles such as  main and lead dancers, who take on dance solos.<br><br>Since 2012, the combination of a large group with specialized dance positions facilitated a new trend: third-generation groups began incorporating formation choreography and transitions into their performances. Examples include <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"exo\">EXO’s</span> V-to-X formation and <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"seventeen\">Seventeen’s</span> “chain reaction.”","outro1":"Relative to other music genres, K-pop is young. But since 1992, the K-pop industry has repeatedly reinvented itself based on the responses it receives from South Korean society. Group positions, with their clearly defined functions, mirror the hierarchical ethos of South Korea. As international as K-pop has become, it remains steeped in South Korea’s ethos.","outro2":"What we now recognize as key characteristics of K-pop groups—their large group sizes and varied group positions—were once new ideas that became tenets of the K-pop playbook. So while BTS is commendable in many ways, it’s success did not emerge from nowhere.","methodology":"The dataset for K-pop groups was based on Wikipedia’s list of South Korean idol groups. We then narrowed the list to include only groups with K-pop listed as one of their genres (except Seo Taiji and Boys, because they were the first K-pop group). Group sizes and positions were collected from <a href=https://kprofiles.com/>K Profiles</a>. We determined the top 10 third-generation groups based on Gaon’s Album Chart from 2011 to 2019.","footerbyline":"Design and illustrations by Joceline Kuswanto and Griselda Gabriele<br>Code and design by Kevin Litman-Navarro","a":[],"b":[],"c":[],"d":[],"e":[]}
