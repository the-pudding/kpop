{"intro1":"This is <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"bts\">BTS</span>, or ‘Beyond the Scene,’ the hottest K-pop band right now.","intro2":"In fact, they are en route to becoming the biggest band in the world. Since debuting in 2013, BTS has set world records on Billboard, Youtube, and Twitter, and embarked on sold-out world tours, outperforming Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. In fact, the group’s popularity has been likened to <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"BTS stan army\">Beatlemania</span> of the 60s. And by raking in $3.6 billion in 2019, BTS sure is giving the Beatles a run for their money.","intro3":"All these accolades ought to give the K-pop industry—long criticized for churning out cookie-cutter <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"What is an idol\">idols</span> and music—cause for celebration. Except BTS is an outlier in K-pop. They did not debut under any of the <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"Context about the big 3 agencies\">‘Big 3’ entertainment agencies</span> at the time, whose deep pockets help groom trainees into superstars. BTS members also produce some of their own music and manage their own Twitter accounts, a rarity in an industry known for its tight control over all aspects of stars’ lives.<br><br>This apparent tension got us wondering: Is BTS a phenomenon because they do not fit the K-pop mold, or do they just play the game better than everyone else?","intro4":"To try and answer the question, we analyzed data on X K-pop bands collected from X website, and the answer lies somewhere in between. While critics of K-pop say that it’s formulaic, and that it’s too big of an institution to innovate, history proves otherwise. K-pop has always been about reinvention. What we now recognize as key characteristics of K-pop groups—their big group sizes and varied group positions—were once new ideas that became central tenets of the K-pop playbook. So while BTS is commendable in many ways, their success was built on the shoulders of giants.","intro5":"To understand BTS’s place in K-pop, let’s take it back to 1992, when <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"seo\">Seo Taiji and Boys</span>—widely regarded as the world’s first K-pop band—formed.","bars1":"Seo Taiji and Boys burst onto Korea’s entertainment scene in 1992, a streetwear-clad trio (complete with <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"history in streetwear\">ski gloves</span>) breakdancing to catchy rap tunes. Despite receiving the lowest[ratings]? in the history of a televised program [in South Korea]? During their debut performance, the audience lapped it up, presumably starved after years of listening to <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"why relevant to kpop\">censored, nationalistic songs</span>.<br><br>Not long after, other groups tried to emulate their runaway success with a <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"some copycat examples\">similar three-member, leader-vocalist-rapper configuration</span>.","bars2":"The next K-pop revolution came in the mid-2000s, when <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"super\">Super Junior</span> and <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"girls\">Girls’ Generation</span> debuted under SM Entertainment.<br><br>Their large sizes made both groups outliers initially, but their stratospheric rise convinced the rest of the industry of the merits of large groups. Fans could now pick their 'bias' (favorite member) from a bevy of idols, and groups could perform elaborate choreography without backup dancers.","bars3":"The third generation of idols took note of this, but went even further, perhaps out of necessity to differentiate themselves from the rising number of K-pop groups over the years. At the same time, K-pop began to evolve from a regional genre to a global phenomenon.","bars4":"We start seeing 'super-size groups'—10 members and more—emerging at a consistent rate in the 2010s. In part this is because K-pop agencies began proactively holding global auditions in hopes of widening K-pop’s international appeal. By scouting beyond home ground, agencies had a large talent pool to draw from when forming new K-pop groups.","bars5":"Larger groups have the flexibility of breaking into smaller 'subunits'. Subunits are extensions of the main group that have different concepts, music genres, or songs produced in non-Korean languages to target a diverse range of markets.<br><br>One K-pop group,  <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"nct\">New Culture Technology (NCT)</span>, has taken this to the nth degree. At 21 members, they are currently the largest group in K-pop history. But their creator, <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"notes on Lee Soo-man\">Lee Soo-man</span>, is relentless. He envisions NCT with an unlimited number of members, a subunit planted in every city in the world. Talk about world domination through the soft power of K-pop.","topten1":"Another recent innovation in the K-pop world is “idol survival shows”. Here’s how these work: several trainees from various entertainment agencies compete in televised challenges to eventually debut together as a new girl or boy group. The most popular show, <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"some of the bands\">Produce 101</span>, allows fans to 'produce' their dream K-pop group from 101 trainees by voting on the group’s concept, debut song, name, and member line-up. The band is literally a product of popular choice.","topten2":"Looking at the top ten K-pop groups by record sales in 2019, we can see this has proven to be a lucrative strategy. Nine of the top 10 bands have co-opted the subunits strategy, and three are the product of idol survival shows.","topten3":"This leaves BTS as the only third-generation group in the top 10 without a subunit, and one formed by the then small outfit, BigHit Entertainment, rather than from idol survival shows sponsored by bigger companies.","topten4":"BTS’s seemingly humble beginnings are core to their appeal — they come across as relatable and authentic artists who happen to be global superstars, rather than inaccessible idols. That’s not to say that BTS’s success was by luck. They had the foresight to sign with a smaller agency, despite being scouted by more established agencies, and this gave them greater artistic freedom and control over the group’s direction.","rankings0":"It also helps that BTS’s main medium of expression is rap, which has historically, and more so in recent years, resurfaced as the popular anthem for the disenfranchised and marginalised. Their songs speak to youths around the world, who see their struggles reflected in themes like mental health, generational divides, and school pressure.","rankings01":"A lot of the credit goes to BTS’s ‘rap line’, who drew on their own experiences when co-writing their songs. This brings us to the other half of what makes K-pop groups unique—group configuration. Whereas most pop rock bands typically consist of a lead singer, drummer, bassist, and guitarist, K-pop groups are constructed in lines, or categories, which are divided into specialized roles. A rap line, for example, can be made up of a lead rapper, a main rapper, and a sub rapper, each with a part to play.","rankings02":"Such segmentation creates a clear division of labour in terms of allocating screen time, song parts, and placement in photoshoots and performances. While positions are usually assigned based on individual ability, they also signal who the important members are, by placing them in popular positions.","rankings03":"But what’s considered popular changes. Across K-pop’s history, a hugely popular group or member can result in the waxing and waning of certain positions. <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"jungkook\">Jungkook</span> from BTS popularized the maknae role, supposedly the ‘baby’ of the group, by defying expectations. He excelled in everything, giving him the nickname, “Golden Maknae”, and played pranks on his hyungs (the older BTS members).","rankings04":"Apart from BTS, how have other icons incentivized the industry to adapt, and in doing so, made K-pop groups the way they are today? Let’s take a look.","rankings1":"To investigate how other positions have changed over time, we looked at what percentage of K-pop bands in each generation had a member fulfilling each role. It’s clear how much more important the maknae role is today than it was when Seo Taiji and Boys first sported ski gloves. In fact, all the groups that debuted in 2018 and 2019 had maknaes. The ‘maknae line versus hyung/unnie (elder brother/sister) line’ dynamic, specifically, came to define the third generation of K-pop groups. Popularized by <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"blackpink\">BLACKPINK</span> and BTS, it features younger members engaging in goofy antics at the expense of older members. This helps showcase the group’s dynamics and endear fans (who are closer in age to the maknaes), translating to greater popularity for the group.","rankings2":"Popularized by Seo Taiji and Boys, and<span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"djdoc\"> DJ DOC</span> in the early 90s, rap fit into the zeitgeist of a new and fully democratic South Korea. These groups wrote lyrics criticizing the government, education system, and other social injustices. Their words spoke to the sinsedae (new) generation, who grew up consuming American media in the backdrop of an authoritarian regime. For these groups, rap formed the core of their identities, as seen in their choice of clothes, music, and choreography.<br><br>As the Hallyu (Korean) wave swept K-pop into the international spotlight during the late 90s, the K-pop industry had to keep up with demand. This meant fine-tuning the system for easy replication, resulting in less experimentation and more standardization. Main and lead rappers—who had clear directions on who would rap more lines and during which parts—grew under this new direction.","rankings3":"Unlike rap, which eventually branched into the more specific main and lead positions, the vocalist position continues to dominate through the years. Because vocalists support the main and lead vocalists by singing only a few lines, they are usually more of a filler position. Members who are vocalists typically have main or lead positions in other categories.","rankings4":"K-pop aesthetics today are almost as well-known as their songs—colorful hair, distinctive concept albums, and slick music videos.<br><br>But up until 2006, the positions of the face and the visual were almost non-existent. Their value-add, compared to 'skill-based' positions like vocalists, were not obvious.<br><br>Enter <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"yoona\">Yoona</span> from Girls’ Generation. As the visual of the band, she skyrocketed the group’s popularity by appearing in many television ads and variety shows. The industry noticed; since Girls’ Generation debuted in 2007, there has been a spike in both face and visual roles in K-pop, with visual roles taking the lead for the most part.","rankings5":"Changes in dance positions and group size go hand in hand. Group sizes were small in the 1990s, and there wasn’t really a need to designate a dancer position, as everyone danced in unison. As groups expanded, they took on enough members to fill more specific roles like main and lead dancers, who take on dance solos.<br><br>Since 2012, the combination of a large group with specialized dance positions facilitated a new trend: third-generation groups began incorporating formation choreography and transitions into their performances. Examples include <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"exo\">EXO’s</span> V-to-X formation and <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"seventeen\">Seventeen’s</span> ‘chain reaction’.","outro1":"Relative to other music genres, K-pop is young. But since 1992, the K-pop industry has repeatedly reinvented itsef based on the responses it receives from South Korean society. Group positions, with their clearly defined functions, mirror the hierarchical ethos of South Korea. Group sizes have evolved alongside South Korea’s consumption habits, as greater access to online content called for bigger and showier performances. As international as K-pop has become, it remains steeped in South Korea’s ethos, which may explain why <span class=tooltip-highlight data-tippy-content=\"name some flops\">foreign ‘K-pop’ groups</span> have all been flops.","outro2":"To many, especially in the West, BTS may be their first exposure to K-pop. That’s understandable, since no group has broken into the U.S. market quite as successfully before. And even though the boys deserve all the hype, BTS’s success did not emerge from nowhere. To paraphrase another rap legend, <span class=tooltip-highlight-gif data-tippy-content=\"jayz\">Jay-Z</span>, K-pop ran so that BTS could fly.","methodology":"The dataset for K-pop groups was based on Wikipedia’s list of South Korean idol groups. We then narrowed the list to include only groups with K-pop listed as a genre (except Seo Taiji and Boys, because they were the first K-pop group). Group sizes and positions were collected from K Profiles. We determined the top 10 third-generation groups based on Gaon’s Album Chart from 2011–2019.","footerbyline":"Design and illustrations by Joceline Kuswanto and Griselda Gabriele<br>Code, editing, and design by Kevin Litman-Navarro"}
